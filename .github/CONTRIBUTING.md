# Want to contribute? You're Awesome!

Developer patches are essential for improving this code base. We simply can't thank you enough. I want to keep it as easy as possible to contribute changes that get things working in your environment. There are a few guidelines that are recommended for contributors to follow so that we have a chance of keeping on top of things and merging your Pull Request.

### Getting Started 

- Read this documentation
- Submit a ticket for your issue, assuming one does not already exist
  - Clearly describe the issue including steps to reproduce when it is a bug
  - Make sure you fill in the earliest version that you know has the issue
  - If you are working on a bug, comment and let us know about it.
- Fork the repository on GitHub

### Setting up

- Set up clean WordPress installation
- Clone the theme in *wp-content/* folder and activate it
- Import the [Theme Unit Test](https://codex.wordpress.org/Theme_Unit_Test) XML file 

### Submitting a Pull Request

- Make your changes in a new branch
```git
git checkout -b my-new-branch
```
- Create you patch. Make sure it works with the test data
- Follow adopted conventions
- Commit your messages using a descriptive commit message
- In Github, send a pull request to `gramophone:master`
- If the PR gets too outdated we may ask you to rebase and force push your PR

### The GPL v2 and above.

Both WordPress and Bootstrap licence their projects under this licence, and therefore Gramophone inherits it. Any contributions you make to this project will also fall into this licence (GNU General Public Licence v2). If there is an issue with this, please consider withholding your pull request... but we'd still love you to contribute!
